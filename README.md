# NodeJS Toy Robot Simulator

This is a NodeJS command-line application.
# Unit Testing

A screenshot of running `npm test`. While development with TDD, `npm run test:watch` is being run to watch for any file changes in both the core scripts and its associated unit test scripts.

# Constraint

Assuming that we would only have 5x5 units of "table" for the toy robot to roam about freely, without falling off.


# Development Setup

- This is developed with Node v18.7.0 and NPM 8.18.0
- TDD development with `npm run test:watch`
- Run the application with `npm start`
- To plainly run the test scripts `npm test`# nodejs-toy-robot-simulator
